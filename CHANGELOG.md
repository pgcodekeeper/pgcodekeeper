## [6.4.0] - 2022-03-25

### Added

- It is now possible to recursively load pgCodeKeeper libraries, which are referenced by other libraries added to the project. Library must be in a project (or project archive) format to have its own dependences, which must be listed in its .dependencies file. This option is disabled by default so that behaviour of existing projects doesn't change. Users can enable this new mechanism in project settings. In a general case, for library dependencies to be loaded, container of that library must have its loadNested flag set in .dependencies file. For instance, in this dependency chain: project → lib1 → lib2 → lib3, lib2 will be loaded if project has the option enabled, and lib3 will be loaded if the option is set in both project and lib1.
- Added a tree view of referenced libraries and their structure in Project Explorer.

## [5.0.0] - 2018-08-01

### Changed

- SQL code generation has been changed. All SQL statements are now created for `search_path = pg_catalog`. This improves security and stability of generated code, for more information see PostgreSQL 10.3 changelog. Because of this, differences in name qualification will be found when comparing projects with DBs. Projects need to be updated to the new format by saving these differences. Using constant `search_path` for SQL code generation allows JDBC loader to read objects from all schemas with a single query. This greatly improves schema load speeds and allows us to get rid of server helper functions, they are no longer used. Work with `pg_dbo_timestamp` extension is also greatly sped up.

### Added

- New workflow for the migration editor — `Quick Update`. If you introduce schema changes directly in pgCodeKeeper now you'll be able to save your changes, generate a migration, apply that migration and update your project using a single hotkey — Ctrl+Alt+A.

- CLI mode now allows users to connect to DB using JDBC connection string.

## [3.8.0] - 2016-12-06

### Added

- Another JDBC DB reader mode has been added. This mode improves performance when working with DBs containing large number of schemas and while using limited bandwith connections. To use it, it is necessary to install "helper" stored procedures in the DB being read. To do so, open pgCodeKeeper perspective (Window - Perspective), choose pgCodeKeeper - Install JDBC Performance Helpers in the main menu and apply the script to the DB in question. After this the new enhanced reader will be used automatically with this DB.

Errant files are marked in the project tree, errant places are underlined in pgCodeKeeper SQL editor (enable pgCodeKeeper SQL editor by clicking the file SQL — Open With — pgCodeKeeper SQL editor with a right mouse button). For updating markers in the project make sure that pgCodeKeeper builder is enabled (how to enable: click the project with a right mouse button — select pgCodeKeeper, then — Add builder).

### Changed

- pgCodeKeeper builder operation has been improved: frequent updating and smooth progress bar displaying.

## [3.6.2] - 2016-08-24

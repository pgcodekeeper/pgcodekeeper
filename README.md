# pgCodeKeeper

A tool for easier PostgreSQL development.

* Comparing database code is very easy now. Compare live DB instances, pg_dump output, as well as pgCodeKeeper projects.
* Generate migration scripts via a user-friendly interface. You can use both live DB instances and DB dumps as initial data. You can also compare pgCodeKeeper projects — useful when working with versions control systems.
* pgCodeKeeper is an [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org) plug-in. The DB code is saved as an Eclipse project, and the project can be tracked under any of the versions control systems supported by Eclipse — Git, SVN, Mercurial, CVS and many others.

#### ru.taximaxim.codekeeper.ui.tests

Simple tests for core logic wrappers: `DbSource`, `Differ`, `ProjectUpdater`.

### Program Lifecycle

General program lifecycle goes as follows:
1. `PgDiffArguments` object is filled with operation parameters.
2. `PgDatabase`s are loaded from requested sources, including their libraries and privilege overrides. Ignored schemas are skipped at this step.
   1. During the load dependencies of each object are found and recorded. Expressions are also analyzed to extract their dependencies including overloaded function calls.
   2. All parser and expression analysis operations are run in parallel using `AntlrParser.ANTLR_POOL` thread pool to speed up the process. Parallel operations are serialized by calling `finishLoaders` at the end of each loading process.
3. The diff tree (represented by root `TreeElement`) is created by comparing two `PgDatabase`s. In GUI this is then shown to the user to assess the situation and choose objects to work with.
4. The diff tree, now containing "user selection", is used to selectively update project files on disk, or to generate a migration script.
5. In latter case, each "selected" TreeElement is passed to `DepcyResolver` to generate script actions fulfilling the requested change, including actions on dependent objects. To do this, JGraphT object dependency graphs are built using dependency information found at the loading stage.
6. Generated actions are now converted into SQL code with some last-moment post-processing and filtering.
7. Generated SQL script is written to a file/stdout or shown in the GUI for user to review and run on their database.
